In this notebook, we will explore two more recent models that also aim to learn high-quality visual representations and have demonstrated strong and robust performance on a variety of downstream tasks.\n","\n","\n","First, we will examine the [CLIP](https://github.com/openai/CLIP) model. Like SimCLR, CLIP uses a contrastive learning objective, but instead of contrasting two augmented views of the same image, it contrasts two different modalities: text and image. To train CLIP, OpenAI collected a large dataset of ~400M image-text pairs from the internet, including sources like Wikipedia and image alt text. The resulting model learns rich, high-level image features and has achieved impressive zero-shot performance on many vision benchmarks.\n","\n","Next, we will explore [DINO](https://github.com/facebookresearch/dino), a self-supervised learning method for vision tasks that applies contrastive learning in a self-distillation framework with multi-crop augmentation strategy. The authors showed that the features learned by DINO ViTs are fine-grained and semantically rich with explicit information about the semantic segmentation of the image.\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"JZJOAUKaoze_"},"source":["# CLIP\n","\n","As explained above, CLIP's training objective incorporates both text and images, building upon the principles of contrastive learning. Consider this quote from the SimCLR notebook:\n",">The goal of the contrastive loss is to maximize agreement between the final vectors **$z_i = g(h_i)$** and **$z_j = g(h_j)$**.\n","\n","Similarly, CLIP is trained to maximize agreement between two vectors. However, because these vectors come from different modalities, CLIP uses two separate encoders: a transformer-based Text Encoder and a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based Image Encoder. Note that some smaller, more efficient versions of CLIP use a ResNet as the Image Encoder instead of a ViT.\n","\n","Run the cell below to visualize the training and inference pipeline of CLIP.\n","\n","During the pretraining phase, each batch consists of multiple images along with their corresponding captions. Each image is independently processed by an Image Encoder—typically a visual model like a Vision Transformer (ViT) or a Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet)—which produces an image embedding $I_n$. Likewise, each caption is independently processed by a Text Encoder to generate a corresponding text embedding $T_n$. Next, we compute the pairwise similarities between all image-text combinations, meaning each image is compared with every caption, and vice versa. The training objective is to maximize the similarity scores along the diagonal of the resulting similarity matrix -- that is, the scores for the matching image-caption pairs $(I_n, T_n)$.  Through backpropagation, the model learns to assign higher similarity scores to true matches than to mismatched pairs.\n","\n","Through this setup, CLIP effectively learns to represent images and texts in a shared latent space.

You should achieve a mean IoU greater than 0.45 on the first test frame and greater than 0.50 on the last test frame. To prevent overfitting on the training patch features, consider designing a very lightweight model (e.g., a linear layer or a 2-layer MLP) and applying appropriate weight decay.\n","\n","You may use GPU runtime to speed up training and evaluation.
